  - our 💾  Cartridge is complete!
  - that means, I can now patch your code so that BrokenNEEES uses your implementation
  - and we'll at least get rid of the broken CHR-ROM bug 🐞
  - are you ready?

  - ✅  done!
  - <! 💾  Cartridge integrated.
  - now, the 💾  icon in the emulator will glow ✨

  - try opening some games, they will look waaay better 😉
