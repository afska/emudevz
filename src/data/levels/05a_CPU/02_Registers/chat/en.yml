    📚  they should have two methods:
    **getValue()**:
      **->** returns the register's content
    **setValue(value)**:
      **->** sets the register's content
  - 📚  the register's content starts from 0 and can be an 8-bit number (~0-255~) or a 16-bit number (~0-65535~), depending on the class

  - (*) what if I try to write off the limits? 🚫 [limit]
  - (*) what's the best way to implement this? 🤔 [implement]
  - ✅  I created the classes, now what? [nowwhat]

  - it wraps 🎁 , and the resulting value always ends up being inside the valid range

    here, some examples:
    ```raw ___________________________
    |  Type  | Write | Result |
    |--------|-------|--------|
    | 8-bit  | 258   | 2      |
    | 8-bit  | 518   | 6      |
    | 8-bit  | -2    | 254    |
    | 8-bit  | -128  | 128    |
    | 8-bit  | -200  | 56     |
    | 16-bit | 65536 | 0      |

  - I'd create typed arrays containing just one element, like ```javascript new Uint8Array(1)``` and ```javascript new Uint16Array(1)```
  - then, when you do something like ```javascript array[0] = 258;```, the wrapping will be performed automatically ✨

    📚  then, add the following to your `CPU` class' constructor:
      ```javascript
      this.a = new Register8Bit();
      this.x = new Register8Bit();
      this.y = new Register8Bit();
      this.sp = new Register8Bit();
      this.pc = new Register16Bit();```
