  - as you saw in the Assembly chapter, there's also a 🏁  <Flags> register that represents the processor status
  - |-
    it's an 8-bit register, in which each bit has a special meaning:
     ```raw _______________________________```
    ```raw | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |```
    ```raw |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|```
    ```raw |``` ~N~ ```raw |``` ~V~ ```raw |``` ```raw 1``` ```raw |``` ```raw b``` ```raw |``` ~D~ ```raw |``` ~I~ ```raw |``` ~Z~ ```raw |``` ~C~ ```raw |```
     ```raw ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾```
  - we already covered C ("Carry") and Z ("Zero") in the past, and we'll talk about the others when we start coding CPU instructions
  - all flags are represented by an uppercase letter

  - not <all> of them 😑 [notall]

  - right, right, with some exceptions
  - bit 5 is always 1
  - bit 4 ("b")... depends... on... things - we'll ignore it for now 😂

  - fair enough, what should I do? [what]

  - 📚  create a `FlagsRegister` class with 6 boolean properties (called ~c~, ~z~, ~i~, ~d~, ~v~ and ~n~)
  - initialize them with ```javascript false```
  - then, implement ```javascript getValue()``` and ```javascript setValue(value)``` following the previous table
  - "`getValue()` should return an 8-bit number with all the flags" 
  - "`setValue(...)` should assign all the flags from the received 8-bit number" 
  - i.e. with ~i~ and ~v~ on, ```javascript getValue()``` should return ```javascript 0b01100100```
  - and ```javascript setValue(0b00000010)``` should set all booleans to ```javascript false```, except for ~z~

  - (*) I need a bit of help 📐 [bits]
  - ✔️  I have the class [nowwhat]

  messages:
  - 📄  ~/lib/byte.js~ comes to the rescue 🙌
  - to build the value on ```javascript getValue()```, use `bitfield`
  - to get the flags on ```javascript setValue(value)```, use `getFlag`
  responses:
  - ...what

  - "great, just add a new instance to the `CPU` class, below the other registers, like this:\n  ```javascript this.flags = new FlagsRegister();```"
