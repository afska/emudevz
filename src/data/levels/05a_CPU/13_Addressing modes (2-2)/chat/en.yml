  - the indexed modes...
  - time to implement them as well
  - take a look at the example pseudocode in the documentation 👀
  - you have to be careful and apply the appropriate ```javascript byte.toU8(...)``` and ```javascript byte.toU16(...)``` calls
  - e.g. in the "Absolute,X" mode, if the <input> is $FFFF and [X] is 3, the <output> must be $0002 (not $10002)
  - 📚  following 📄  ~/docs/cpu/addressing_modes.en.md~,
  - implement the missing modes!
