  - so far, we only ran programs without any branching logic
  - let's change that
  - 6502 assembly has multiple branching instructions 🌲
  - all of which branch on whether certain flags are set or not
  responses:
  - (*) 6502 what? 🤔 [asm6502]
  - ok how do I branch [how]

  - that's the name of the NEEES processor, "6502"
  - each assembly language targets one specific CPU
  - with its own set of instructions
  - so, we're writing "6502 assembly" 🙂

  - here's what happened
  - "`CPX #3` 'ComPares' [X] with 3, and sets the Zero Flag if they're equal"
  - "`BNE @decrement` jumps to that label if the Zero Flag is not set"
  - since [X] has a 7, then Z is still 0
  - and because Z is 0, `BNE @decrement` jumped 🦘
  - ([X] and 3 were "Not Equal", hence the name)

  messages:
  - the opposite of `BNE` is `BEQ`, which jumps when the numbers are equal
  - let's practice 👾
  - 📚  delete the current code
  - and build a program that reads the value of $4080
  - if it has a 7, writes $EE to $40BF
  - if not, writes $AA to $40BF
  - then, run the `test` command
  responses:
  - wait, how do I test this? 🧪 [testing]
  - I need help 😅 [help]

testing:
  messages:
  - I set up a random number generator 🔢
  - every time you change/run your code, it'll set either a 7 or another random byte on $4080
  - with 50% of chances each
  - so when it's 7, your code should write $EE
  - and when it's not, $AA should be written
  responses: []

help:
  messages:
  - 🔀  you want to always use `BEQ` and `BNE` after a comparison instruction (like `CPX`)
  - "`CPX` sets the flag Z=1 if [X] equals the value, and then `BEQ`/`BNE` jump depending on whether Z is 1 or 0"
  - 🏷️  also, remember that labels are ignored unless we have to jump to any of them
  - 🛑  if you ever need to stop the program, you can put a label at the very end of the code
  - and use a branch instruction to jump to it
  - or more simply, just use the `BRK` instruction, which halts the execution 😉
