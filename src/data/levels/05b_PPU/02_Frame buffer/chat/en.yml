  - we'll store our image data in something called frame buffer
  - it's basically a big array with the color of each pixel
  - each element is a 32-bit number __$aabbggrr__
  - "\"aa\" represents the opacity (in our NEEES it's always $FF)"
  - "\"bb\", \"gg\" and \"rr\" represent the amount of <blue>, <green> and <red>"

  - first of all, I'm gonna integrate your 🖥️  PPU into the emulator
  - it should be quick...

  - ✅  done!
  - <! 🖥️  PPU integrated.
  - now, the 🖥️  icon in the emulator will glow ✨
  - as there's almost no PPU code, nothing will be shown for now
  - but we'll get there!

  - let's code this 🤟 [exercise]

    📚  ok, let's add this to your PPU's constructor:
      ```javascript
      this.frameBuffer = new Uint32Array(256*240);```
  - |-
    📚  implement this method:
    **plot(x, y, color)**:
      **->** assigns the `color` to the pixel ~(x,y)~ in the `frameBuffer` array
        (the index for ~(x,y)~ should be ```javascript y * 256 + x```)
  - 📚  then, modify your `step` method so it receives an `onFrame` callback as parameter
  - |-
    📚  and every time you detect a new frame (right after ```javascript this.frame++;```), call it with the frame buffer, like this:
      ```javascript onFrame(this.frameBuffer);```
  - |-
    📚  to ensure that everything works correctly, add this code before the `onFrame` call:
      ```javascript
      // <test>
      for (let x = 0; x < 256; x++) {
        for (let y = 0; y < 240; y++) {
          this.plot(x, y, 0xff000000 | this.frame % 256);
        }
      }
      // </test>```
  - try it! when loading a ROM, it should slowly paint the screen in red 🔴
