  - create a file in ~/code/Cartridge.js~
  - its default export should be an empty class
  - then, import that file from ~/code/index.js~
  - and export an object with only one key ("Cartridge") pointing to that class

  - export? modules? 🧐 [modules]

modules:
  messages:
  - yeah, every file is a module, and it has <exported> value
  - that value can be any JS expression, and it can be used elsewhere by <importing> the module
  - you can learn the syntax by running `help`
