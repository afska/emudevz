  messages:
  - sometimes, values are represented using more than 1 byte
  - e.g. when a CPU instruction has a 16-bit address as an argument
  - or when using the `RTS` instruction and the CPU needs to restore [PC] from the stack
  - in these cases, the <Little Endian> convention is used 🔌
  - "that means: the least significant byte (\"low byte\") is stored first, then the most significant byte (\"high byte\")"

    📚  implement this method in `CPUMemory`:
    **read16(address)**:
      __-> returns a 16-bit number using the bytes of <address> (low byte) and <address>+1 (high byte)__
  - |-
    and these two methods in `Stack`:
    **push16(value)**:
      __-> *pushes* the high byte first, then *pushes* the low byte__
    **pop16()**:
      __-> returns a 16-bit number after *popping* from the stack two times (first the low byte, then the high one)__
  - 💡  remember to use 📄  ~/lib/byte.js~!
