  messages:
  - our CPU is almost working now
  - let's talk about <mappers> 🧠
  - they're circuits inside the cartridge that control how the ROM data is read by the console
  - each game uses a specific mapper, but some use "Mapper 0"
  responses:
  - so, what's Mapper 0? 🤔 [mapper0]

mapper0:
  messages:
  - it's the most basic mapper there is
  - in which one or two 16 KiB PRG-ROM chips are directly mapped to 💻  CPU memory
  - and one 8 KiB CHR-ROM (or RAM!) chip is mapped to 🖥️  PPU memory
  responses:
  - (*) what's the benefit of using a more complex mapper? [complex]
  - ✔️  cool, so how can I implement mappers? [implement]

complex:
  messages:
  - more advanced mappers offer more flexibility to game developers
  - for example, they can add RAM, generate IRQs on certain scanlines, or even switch between different banks of ROM data
  - this allows games to have more complex logic, save data, or use advanced graphics and sound effects
  - but for simple games, Mapper 0 is more than enough 😊
  responses:
  - ...mapper0

implement:
  messages:
  - you'll deal with them in the Mappers chapter
  - as always, the first one is free 😎
  - so check out my "mapper 0" implementation in 📄  ~/lib/NROM.js~
  - the only thing you have to do is integrate it with your existing code
  - 📚  create a `mappers` module that contains all the mappers
  - |-
    for now, it should look like this:
      ```javascript
      import NROM from "/lib/NROM";

      export default { 0: NROM }```
  - |-
    import that module where you have your `NEEES` class, and add this code:
      ```javascript
      class NEEES {
        constructor(bytes) {
          this.cartridge = new Cartridge(bytes);

          // >>> 👇
          const Mapper = mappers[this.cartridge.header.mapperId];
          if (!Mapper) throw new Error("Invalid mapper.");
          this.mapper = new Mapper(this);
          // <<<
          
          this.cpu = new CPU(this.mapper); // <<< 👈
        }

        // ... <rest of your NEEES class> ...
      }```
  responses:
  - wait, now `CPU` receives the mapper? [wait]

wait:
  messages:
  - yeah, change `CPU` and `CPUMemory` to receive the mapper instead of the cartridge
  - "and modify your `CPUMemory` in the following way:"
  - 🚫  remove the test mapping we added in the 'Insert cartridge' level (the one that maps $8000-$BFFF to PRG-ROM)
  - 🗺️  map $4020-$FFFF so it redirects everything to the mapper (`read(...)` should call `mapper.cpuRead(...)` and `write(...)` should call `mapper.cpuWrite(...)`)
