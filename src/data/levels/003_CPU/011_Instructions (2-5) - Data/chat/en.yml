  - right, sorry... 🤣
  - in `PHP`, you should push a number to the stack
  - that number is the result of calling `cpu.flags.getValue()`
  - but you should set its bit 4 to 1 (use `byte.setBit(flags, 4, 1)`)
  responses:
  - why? [why]

why:
  messages:
  - because that's what the hardware does!
  - as emulator developers, we don't care about <why> things work in a certain way
  - we only care about <how> they work 🤷
  - so you turn that bit 4 on, please
