  - we'll finally add <audio> to our emulator! 🔊
  - it's not as intuitive as <video>, so I'll have to explain a few things first
  responses:
  - how does it work? [how]

how:
  messages:
  - 📈  <audio> works by defining waves that directly match what the speakers do
  - 🎵  when a speaker vibrates at a particular frequency, it creates a note
  - 🌊  since time is a <continuous unit>, computers store waves as a stream of samples, which are numbers that define the height of the wave at a certain point in time
  - 🔢  in the NEEES, samples are numbers in the ~0-15~ range, and when emulating the APU, we feed 44100 samples per second to the sound card
  - that's called the sample rate
  responses:
  - how does a wave look? [wave]
  - how does the APU generate samples? [samples]

wave:
  messages:
  - it looks... periodical!
  - like this, this is a sinoidal wave
  - "// TODO: Explain frequency, period, amplitude"

  - ...how

samples:
  messages:
  - like the CPU and PPU, the APU works with cycles 🚲
  - a cycle is the smallest time unit, corresponding to one clock tick during which it updates its internal state by one step
  - the 🔊  APU runs 2x slower than the 🧠  CPU
  - so APU cycles are slower (each APU cycle is, in time, ~twice as long~ as a CPU cycle)
