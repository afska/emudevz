  - we'll do a quick overview of the APU's audio channels!
  - make sure the <music volume> is not muted, and continue
  responses:
  - ▶️  start [start]

  messages:
  - this is the incredible music of 🦸 🤸  <Super Tilt Bro>
  - here, we can see almost all audio channels in action
  - let's start with the 🟦  Pulse Channels
  responses:
  - what are the Pulse Channels? 🟦 [pulse]

pulse:
  run: |
    if (emulation) {
      emulation.enabledChannels.pulse1 = true;
      emulation.enabledChannels.pulse2 = false;
      emulation.enabledChannels.triangle = false;

    }
  messages:
  - they are channels dedicated to produce pulse waves
  - there are <two> of them
  - this is just <Pulse 1>
  responses:
  - let's hear <Pulse 2> 👀 [pulse2]
  
pulse2:
  run: |
    if (emulation) {
      emulation.enabledChannels.pulse1 = false;

      emulation.enabledChannels.noise = false;
      emulation.enabledChannels.dmc = false;
    }
  messages:
  - this is <Pulse 2>
  - it creates the same kind of waves as <Pulse 1>
  - and the magic starts when they sound together
  responses:
  - let's hear both together [together]

together:
  run: |
    if (emulation) {
      emulation.enabledChannels.pulse1 = true;

    }
  messages:
  - see?
  - these two Pulse channels, combined, can create <powerful melodies> 🎶
  responses:
  - there's a lot going on here [alot]

alot:

      debuggerGUI.apu.selectedTab = "Pulse";
    });
  messages:
  - well... they support a lot of <features>
  - like configurable duty cycles, <volume fades> and <note sweeps>!
  responses:
  - cool! what about the other channels? [triangle]

triangle:
  run: |
    {{Right}}.do((debuggerGUI) => {

    }
  messages:
  - this is the 🔺  Triangle Channel
  - it can create constant-volume triangle waves
  - and it's commonly used for <bass lines> 🎸
  responses:
  - mix it with the main melody 🎶 [pulseagain]

pulseagain:
  run: |

    }
  messages:
  - yeah
  - with this setup, we have main melodies and bass
  - now, the missing part...
  responses:
  - the Noise Channel, I guess? 💥 [noise]

noise:
  run: |
    if (emulation) {

      emulation.enabledChannels.dmc = false;
    }
  messages:
  - yup!
  - the 💥  Noise Channel generates pseudo-random <noise>
  - it's typically used for 🥁  <drums> and 💥  <special effects>
  responses:
  - let's also hear the Triangle Channel 🔺 [addtriangle]

addtriangle:
  run: |
    if (emulation) {
      emulation.enabledChannels.pulse1 = false;

  messages:
  - I can already see your head groovin', let's combine all the channels again!
  responses:
  - yeah! 🤘 [combined]

combined:

      emulation.enabledChannels.dmc = false;
    }
  messages:
  - as you can see, with some <creativity>, you can create pretty nice melodies combining all these channels! ✨
  - there's one extra channel we didn't cover here, the 📦  DMC Channel
  - it allows games provide their custom waves directly to the APU
  - that one will receive special treatment later, so don't worry about it! 
  - I <enabled the controls> in the debugger view so you can play around for a while
  - once you are ready, let me know and we can go back to programming 👀
  responses:
  - ▶️  I'm ready, let's continue [end]
